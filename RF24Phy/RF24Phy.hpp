*   File Name:
*       nrf24l01.hpp
*
*   Description:
*       Interface to the NRF24L01 radio hardware driver. Originally based upon the work done by James Coliz
*       (https://github.com/nRF24/RF24). This version expands on the original by adding more modern C++ features, reliability
*       and safety checks, improved debugging notifications, and more helpful comments to understand how and why things are done.
*
*       The hardware SPI driver has been abstracted away and can be driven by either the Chimera HAL
*       (https://github.com/brandonbraun653/Chimera) or by providing overriding functions of the SPI/GPIO interface as defined
*       in the class below. This allows the driver to be platform agnostic.
